# Automated_pet_feeder
Author: Is Haq Mathew Abraham

Project Description

This project is a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder designed for cats and dogs. It dispenses food at scheduled times, monitors whether the food has been consumed, and sends alerts to staff if there’s an issue, such as food not dispensed, uneaten food, or dispenser faults.

The main goal of this project is to design and simulate the logic and behaviour of the feeder system, which could later be implemented using affordable components like servo motors and sensors.

## Features

Dispenses food at scheduled times

Portion control (maximum 100g per bowl)

Monitors consumption with a 20-minute timer

Sends alerts for low food, dispenser faults, and uneaten food

Logs all feeding events

Updates display with current and next feeding times

## Usage

Check the dispenser status before starting

Display current time, scheduled feeding time, and food level

Dispense food in controlled portions until the target bowl weight is reached

Monitor consumption for 20 minutes and send alerts if necessary

Log the feeding event and prepare for the next scheduled feeding
