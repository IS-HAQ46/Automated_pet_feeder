# Automated_pet_feeder

Author: Is Haq Mathew Abraham

A local animal shelter requires a low-cost, programmable automated pet feeder that can dispense food for cats and dogs at scheduled times, monitor whether the food has been consumed, and alert staff if thereâ€™s an issue (e.g., no food dispensed, food not eaten). This project focuses on designing and simulating the logic and behaviour of the system, which could later be implemented using low-cost components like servo motors and sensors.
